# Palindrome Checker

This repository contains a JavaScript function `palinDrome` that checks whether a given word is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

## Palindrome Checker Function

The `palinDrome` function is designed to check if a word is a palindrome using a recursive approach.

### Usage

To use the `palinDrome` function, simply pass a word as a parameter, and it will return `true` if the word is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.

```javascript
const isPalindrome = palinDrome("level");
console.log(isPalindrome); // Output: true
